**Unit 7: Presidential Leadership, Character, and Rhetoric** <span
id="7"></span> 
*United States presidents are influential, in part, because they embody
an office that is unique to each occupant. A president’s leadership
style, character, and rhetoric can make the difference between an
effective or failed presidency. These attributes are not found in the
Constitution, but rather in the man or woman occupying the oval office.
Leadership can make the difference between a new law and a dead bill; a
powerful and moral character can give a president the political capital
to lead the American people and represent them in the world; and
influential rhetoric can rally the American electorate behind a
president’s agenda. These attributes, while difficult to study, provide
a roadmap of historically successful presidencies and a template for
aspiring presidential candidates to emulate*

     Dr. Barber’s book has become one of the better-known psychological
    analyses on presidential power. Originally writing in the late
    1960s, Dr. Barber made predictions about President Nixon’s term in
    office that were quite accurate, especially the events of the
    Watergate scandal. His argument that presidential personalities
    affect presidential leadership styles is fleshed out in this summary
    of his book.

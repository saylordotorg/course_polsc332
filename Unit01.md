**Unit 1: Foundations of the Presidency** <span id="1"></span> 
*To fully understand the institution of the modern presidency, it is
crucial that you study the origins of the institution. In their earliest
discussions and debates over what the presidency should look like, the
Founding Fathers considered topics such as the duration of the
president’s term, the characteristics that make an effective executive,
and the presidential election process. Largely as a result of their
experience under the tyrannical King George III, the Constitution
granted very few powers explicitly to the president. Over time,
presidents have pushed the limits of their power and created an office
that has changed dramatically from the office envisioned by the
Founders.  
  
 This unit will open with a discussion of the very beginning of the
American presidency by focusing on the Federalist and Anti-Federalist
Papers. These early debates on what the presidency should look like
reveal the concerns that the Framers of the Constitution had with regard
to the executive. You will then focus on Article II of the Constitution,
as well as the amendments to the Constitution that pertain to the
executive branch. Finally, to understand how presidents have tested the
limits of their office over time, we will study several Supreme Court
cases dealing with executive power, particularly during times of war. As
you will learn, historically, presidents tend to have the most success
in expanding their powers in times of war.*

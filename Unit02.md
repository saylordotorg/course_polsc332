**Unit 2: The Foreign Policy and National Security of the President**
<span id="2"></span> 
*<span id="docs-internal-guid-51a3064a-994f-2d24-cf8e-c8ee8914d299">The
Constitution endows the president with the powers of commander-in-chief,
head of state, and chief diplomat. In so doing, the president—and by
extension, the executive branch—is, first and foremost, responsible for
national security of the United States and appropriate foreign relations
with other countries. The president is the leader of the armed forces,
the national intelligence apparatus, and the state department. Although
each president approaches foreign policy differently, the president
traditionally makes use of various institutions and organizations to
carry out his or her foreign policy agenda. Unit 2 provides an overview
of national security, diplomatic, and foreign policy roles of the
president and executive branch. It explains the roles played by the key
institutions and organizations that promulgate the president’s agenda:
The Defense Department, the National Security Council, the Department of
Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the State
Department.  Moreover, with the advent of globalization and
technological advancement, Unit 2 provides an historical analysis of
this changing role and the varying foreign policy agendas of US
presidents. </span>*

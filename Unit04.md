**Unit 4: The President and the Judiciary** <span id="4"></span> 
<span id="docs-internal-guid-51a3064a-9ecd-9be4-0c8d-f069ed03be41">Much
like the relationship between the executive and legislative branches of
the federal government, the relationship between the executive and
judicial branches is intricate and nuanced. The Founding Fathers
intended to maintain a system of checks and balances and a separation of
powers between all the branches of the government. Unit 4 discusses this
system as it relates to the president and the federal courts. One of the
primary historical roles of the Supreme Court is to review the actions
of the other branches of government to ensure that neither the executive
nor legislative branches is violating the Constitution. Therefore, the
first four subunits below discuss judicial review as it pertains to
executive authority. The unit concludes with two subunits that discuss
the political and procedural elements of presidential appointments and
nominations of federal judges.</span>

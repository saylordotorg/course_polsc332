**Unit 3: The President and Congress** <span id="3"></span> 
*<span>The president (and the entire executive branch) exists within a
system of shared powers and checks and balances with the other major
institutions of the federal government. Therefore, in order to fully
understand the presidency, one must understand the nature of the
relationship between the president and Congress and between the
executive and legislative institutions as a whole. To that end, Unit 3
investigates the nature of the shared powers between the president and
Congress. It explores the political causes for the (often contentious)
relationship between Congress and the president. Unit 3 then provides an
examination of some of the key shared powers and governmental
interactions between these two branches of government: presidential
appointment and senatorial confirmation, treaty creation and
ratification, legislation and the presidential veto, congressional
oversight of the president and executive branch, and Congress’s
impeachment power. Finally, this unit concludes with an analysis of some
of the legislative agendas pushed by key presidents in American history.

**Unit 5: The Executive Branch and the Bureaucracy** <span
id="5"></span> 
As head of the executive branch, the president is constitutionally
responsible for executing the laws passed by Congress. The president
does this by controlling the executive branch, a series of agencies
built to carry out the laws. The agencies have varying levels of
independence from the president; the president’s cabinet, for example,
answers directly to the president. Each cabinet agency is headed by a
secretary that the president appoints and can fire at will. These
agencies are for carrying out the laws and for helping the president
accomplish his or her agenda. Other agencies within the bureaucracy are
more independent and are not under such direct control.  
  
 First you will learn about the president’s ability to act as chief
executive. In this role, he or she is capable of influencing the shape
of law by issuing executive orders and signing statements. You will then
learn about the other key figures within the executive branch: the vice
president, the cabinet, the Executive Office of the President, White
House staff, and the executive bureaucracy (various agencies of the
executive branch).

     Instructions: Please listen to Dr. Yackee’s discussion of the
    bureaucracy and rule-making. An under-appreciated duty of the
    executive branch is the rule-making process. Once Congress passes a
    statute, the responsibility falls to the executive branch to figure
    out how the law will take effect. This means the executive branch
    gets to create the specifics about how a bill will be enforced. In
    this web lecture, Dr. Yackee discusses this aspect of the
    bureaucracy. Dr. Yackee is affiliated with the University of
    Wisconsin, Madison.

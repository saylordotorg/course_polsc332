This course examines various topics related to the American presidency
and the executive branch. Unit 1 begins with an introduction to the
origins of the office and the early debates amongst the framers of the
Constitution surrounding the institution of the presidency. The course
will then focus on the components of the Constitution that pertain to
presidential powers. A historical analysis of the expansion of these
powers concludes the unit. Unit 2 and Unit 3 examine the relationship
between the president and the other two branches of the federal
government (Congress and the judiciary, respectively). Unit 4 assesses
the presidency as it relates to national security, international
diplomacy, and foreign policy. Unit 5 transitions into a broader
discussion about the executive branch as an institution. It discusses
the key players in the media spotlight (the vice president and cabinet),
as well as the lesser-known, but essential, federal bureaucracy. This
unit also discusses different models of White House organization, the
role of executive agencies, the president’s relationship with the
bureaucracy, and the Executive Office of the President. Unit 6 surveys
the US presidential election process. Finally, Unit 7 explores the ways
in which different political scientists have defined and qualified
presidential leadership, character, and rhetoric. Upon completion of
this course, you will have an understanding of the complexities and
challenges surrounding the office of the American presidency. You will
also be aware of the important role that the executive branch plays in
our government.
